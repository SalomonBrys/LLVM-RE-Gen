
LLVM Regular Expresion Generator is a compiler that generates state machines
from ASCII POSIX regular expression and compile them in LLVM IR so the compiled
regular expression can be very fast to execute at run-time.

This project is part of the CoCoT project, is EXPERIMENTAL and probably INCOMPLETE.
It is designed to be a proof-of-concept and only handles ASCII characters.
